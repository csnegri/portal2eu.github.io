               <p>Digital participation tools have emerged as valuable instruments in promoting democratic engagement, empowering citizens to actively contribute to the decision-making processes in the EU. Digital participation tools serve as a conduit for fostering civic education, enabling their users to stay informed about complex policy issues and legislative developments, thereby nurturing a better informed and engaged civil society. By democratising access to information and decision-making, these tools fortify the foundation of a vibrant democracy. This especially refers to the European Union, which has been said to suffer from a “democratic deficit.” </p>

                <p>The significance of digital participation tools in enhancing citizen engagement to the democratic process cannot be overstated. These tools overcome geographical boundaries and time constraints, allowing individuals to engage in civic discourse and policy deliberations at their convenience. The digital landscape's interactive nature encourages dynamic interactions between citizens and policymakers, fostering a continuous feedback loop that informs policy formulation and implementation. By lowering the barriers to entry, digital participation tools enable a more diverse range of voices to be heard in public discourse. Additionally, these platforms empower citizens to collaborate, organise, and mobilise around shared concerns, leading to the emergence of bottom-up initiatives that can exert substantial influence. </p>
                <p> In the era where public trust in institutions cannot be taken for granted, digital participation tools may provide the means to rebuild that trust by creating an environment of transparency, inclusivity, and shared ownership. This, however, will only succeed if such tools are carefully designed. Otherwise, they may even contribute to the deterioration of the very values that they aim to protect. In the Portal2EU project, we focus on evaluating the EU’s digital public consultation tool -– the Have Your Say! Platform -– and we propose improvements to its design.</p>

            <div class="bg-light rounded p-4">
            <p> We provide a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach towards achieving improvements on online public consultations within the European Union. With such a wide ranging perspective, we aim to improve the EU’s system of public consultation from three fronts. These three: accessibility, transparency and outreach. Our name is combination of these, plus the concept of participation.</p>

                    <div class="nav nav-tabs mb-3" id="nav-tab" role="tablist">
                        <button class="nav-link bg-transparent active" id="nav-home-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#nav-home" type="button" role="tab" aria-controls="nav-home" aria-selected="true">Participation</button>

                </nav>
                <div class="tab-content" id="nav-tabContent">
                    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="nav-home" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-home-tab">
                        <p>For democratic systems to function effectively, involving and informing the public is essential. A democratic system that does not engage the public risks becoming irrelevant to its voters, creating a discrepancy between policy output and citizen demands. That is why it is vital to enhance public participation, using digital tools, aiming to strengthen democratic legitimacy and cultivate civic responsibility. </p>

                        <p>With Europe's Digital Decade document, the European Commission emphasises the importance of involving EU citizens in the digital public space as a key priority. In the digital target for 2030, the Commission states that digital rights and principles should be solidaristic and inclusive and that “technology should unite, not divide, people’’. </p>

                        <p> Have Your Say!, the existing e-participation tool reveals several challenges. Many citizens do not engage with the Platform, are unaware of it, and/or face disadvantages compared to businesses and advocacy groups. Raising citizens’ awareness and motivation to take part in shaping digital policy is essential for democratic processes within the EU. Have Your Say, as an existing tool, offers potential for improvement. </p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-profile-tab">
                        
                        <p>Have Your Say! provides focused involvement but suffers from limited reach.  Focused engagement occurs because the site is more suited for experts than the general public due to a lack of  accessibility. The lacklustre public engagement with the platform  can be traced to the EU. Declining participation rates need a wide effort of measures to be reversed. A general marketing strategy should be developed to guide outreach, using a combination of increased collaboration with national institutions and civil society organisations to improve general awareness of the Platform. Social media advertising and the development of a mobile application will help expand the reach to users including those with less access to technology. An increased number of female developers in the Platform’s team may improve women’s participation in public consultations.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-contact" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-contact-tab">
                        <p> We identified a number of issues with transparency of the Have Your Say! platform, namely the lack of information regarding the ownership of each consultation, the composition of participants, and the final use of feedback. In line with this, we recommend the following improvements. </p>

                        <p>Comprehensive guidelines about Have Your Say! public consultations should be created. These guidelines should include essential information from the Better Regulation Guidelines and Toolbox in simple language. IT improvements should include the introduction of AI content moderation tools, alternative bot-prevention tools; provision of a point of contact for each initiative as well as information on the reason for the delay; and the elimination of attachments, favouring replacement by direct textual feedback submission. Additionally, Have Your Say! should be equipped with a centralised dashboard to allow users to view and consult open data about public consultations in a user-friendly manner.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-access" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-access-tab">
                        <p>Generally, online consultation platforms should be easily accessible and designed in a user-friendly way, which  efficiently provides information on both their functioning and content. Have Your Say could be improved in terms of usability. To make the website more inclusive, Portal2EU suggests a number of improvements. </p>

                        <p>To make Have Your Say more user-friendly the Platform should use generally accessible language and offer explanations for its search filters. Moreover, it should create easy-to-understand summaries of documents in all official EU languages. For citizens with disabilities, an accessibility toolbar and a mix of textual and visual formats should be introduced. The Platform should adopt a chatbot to assist citizens in navigating across the website and through policy initiatives. Translation tools, including AI-assisted translation, should be implemented to make the Platform more accessible across language boundaries. Furthermore, the EC should prepare an accessibility statement based on the evaluation of an independent certification body, that would be publicly available to citizens.
